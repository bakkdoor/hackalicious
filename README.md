# hackalicious Lisp

This is a simple implementation (initially an interpreter but evolved into a bytecode compiled) for a basic lisp-like language running on top of the Rubinius VM.
It was created during a hacking session with some friends and doesn't have much value aside from educational purposes.
I'm putting this in the open mostly for documentational reasons and because I need to free up some private repositories on my GitHub account.
Do with this whatever you feel like.

This is considered [Beerware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware).
